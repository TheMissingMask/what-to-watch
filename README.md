### what-to-watch

#### handy tools to help alleviate indecision over what episode in a series to watch, or watch movie to watch

At the moment, the movie selection tool is limited to only the movies in the json file, but it does let you choose a genre you fancy and gives some options of films in that genre -- this code is Project 1 of AICore

The what-episode code is to randomly select one episode from a TV series, saving the stress of having to make a decision -- this was just for fun, and is quite useful if wanting to do a bit of a series rewatch
